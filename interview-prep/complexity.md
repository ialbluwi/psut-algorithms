You are very unlikely to encounter questions in programming interviews that require writing proofs. However, you are expected to use asymptotic notation properly and know their limitations (e.g. that two algorithms with the same order of growth are not necessarily as good as each other). You are also expected to be able to (informally) analyze the running time of algorithms and short pieces of code.
(Check [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/time-complexity/how-to-calculate-running-time/#problems) for questions on this. Quiz and exam questions from PSUT's data structures course are also a great place for practice)

A typical thing in programming interviews is that you'd be given a problem to solve, where you are allowed to begin by proposing a solution that is not necessarily efficient. You'd then analyze the running time and suggest improvements to the algorithm or propose a completely new algorithm with a better asymptotic complexity. This cycle of design + analysis + improvement can repeat until you have proposed a solution that is efficient enough.
Here is a video showing an example of this process: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKu_SEDAykw&ab_channel=LifeatGoogle)
