There is no consensus on what should be called "Divide and Conquer". Some call every recursive algorithm a divide and conquer algorithm. Others call an algorithm a divide and conquer algorithm only if it generates 2 or more non-overlapping subproblems, and call a recursive algorithm that generates only 1 subproblem a **decrease and conquer algorithm**. Examples of such algorithms include **binary search** and **Quickselect**.

Problems requiring Decrease and Conquer solutions appear a lot in coding interviews. The following links have lists of problems that you can use to practice both divide and conquer and decrease and conquer:  [[link 1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/divide-and-conquer/), [link 2](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/explore/?category%5B%5D=Divide%20and%20Conquer&difficulty%5B%5D=1&page=1&category%5B%5D=Divide%20and%20Conquer), [link 3](https://leetcode.com/tag/divide-and-conquer/)].
