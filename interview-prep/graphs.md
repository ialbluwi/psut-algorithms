Problems involving graph algorithms [are common in coding interviews](https://www.quora.com/How-often-are-graph-algorithm-based-questions-asked-in-tech-company-interviews). It is a good idea to get your hands dirty practicing (at least) basic questions that involve graph processing. The following list is a good starting point (in addition to the HW1). Once you are comfortable with such a level of questions, you can move on to harder ones on websites like LeetCode.
